		Do you have a Ruby on Rails application you'd like to be faster, more scalable, or just upgraded safely?
		I'm currently open to new contracts doing Ruby on Rails and Postgres scaling and performance work, and Rails upgrades.
		Contact me at <a href="mailto:will@willj.net?subject=Contract%20opportunity">will@willj.net</a> to get started.

				<p>Many people are familiar with Postgres&rsquo; <code>EXPLAIN</code> and <code>EXPLAIN ANALYSE</code> reports, but there are a couple of useful options available when running them that aren&rsquo;t always commonly known that can help you identify and fix potential problem areas. In this article I will go through how I used the <code>BUFFERS</code> report to help massively reduce the IO demands of a problem query, speeding up the query by nearly 1208 times.</p>

				<p>Increasing postgres query performance with additional parameters There&rsquo;s a lot to take in here so feel free to skip ahead to the &ldquo;Improving the performance&rdquo; section if you are getting lost or falling asleep.
In Buffer analysis and tracking IO timings when using EXPLAIN ANALYSE I promised to dig deeper into the specifics of the optimisation that we put in place. This post will go into the details, and hopefully give you some more ideas for helping to optimise your queries in the future.</p>

				<p>A followup to my post about using <code>BUFFERS</code> with <code>EXPLAIN ANALYSE</code> I talk about the IO timing tracking option in Postgres which can give you an exact breakdown of how long each part of a query took in milliseconds of IO time.</p>

				<p>In a recent update Firefox changed the order of it&rsquo;s URL bar suggestions order to make search suggestions appear first before recently visited URLs. This is annoying so I changed it back.</p>
