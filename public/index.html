		Do you have a Ruby on Rails application you'd like to be faster, more scalable, or just upgraded safely?
		I'm currently open to new contracts doing Ruby on Rails and Postgres scaling and performance work, and Rails upgrades.
		Contact me at <a href="mailto:will@willj.net?subject=Contract%20opportunity">will@willj.net</a> to get started.

				<p>A followup to my post about using <code>BUFFERS</code> with <code>EXPLAIN ANALYSE</code> I talk about the IO timing tracking option in Postgres which can give you an exact breakdown of how long each part of a query took in milliseconds of IO time.</p>

				<p>Many people are familiar with Postgres&rsquo; <code>EXPLAIN</code> and <code>EXPLAIN ANALYSE</code> reports, but there are a couple of useful options available when running them that aren&rsquo;t always commonly known that can help you identify and fix potential problem areas. In this article I will go through how I used the <code>BUFFERS</code> report to help massively reduce the IO demands of a problem query, speeding up the query by nearly 1208 times.</p>

				<p>Sometimes you have a test order issue CI that you want to debug locally, and to do that you need to only run the tests that knapsack runs in the relevant shard, in the right order. Here&rsquo;s how to do that!</p>
