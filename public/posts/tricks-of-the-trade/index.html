	<h2>Tricks of the Trade</h2>

	<article>
		<p><a href="http://www.themorningnews.org/archives/how_to/tricks_of_the_trade.php" title="Tricks of the trade">Interesting article</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;I recently asked readers for their &ldquo;tricks of the trade,&rdquo; and was amazed by the response. It seems every profession is rich with clever little occupational secrets.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Juggler</strong></p>
<p>With any routine under seven minutes (which is almost all of them), you only really need one thing: a good closer. And there are only two things you really need to know about a great closer. First, it needs to be impressive. That sounds obvious, but most beginning jugglers think &ldquo;difficult&rdquo; and &ldquo;impressive&rdquo; are synonymous. Your closer must <em>look</em> hard, but thereâ€™s no real reason it has to <em>be</em> hard. Secondly, you should intentionally blow your closer on the first two tries. If you get it on the first try it looks too easy, but if you &ldquo;miss&rdquo; it a few times it looks harder and builds tension.</p>
</blockquote>
