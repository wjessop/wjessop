				<p>Many people are familiar with Postgres&rsquo; <code>EXPLAIN</code> and <code>EXPLAIN ANALYSE</code> reports, but there are a couple of useful options available when running them that aren&rsquo;t always commonly known that can help you identify and fix potential problem areas. In this article I will go through how I used the <code>BUFFERS</code> report to help massively reduce the IO demands of a problem query, speeding up the query by nearly 1208 times.</p>

				<p>The Dell OptiPlex 7010 USFF officially only has room for one 2.5&quot; hard drive internally, I fitted two 3.25&quot; hard drives and a 2.5&quot; SSD in one.</p>

				<p>Sometimes you have a test order issue CI that you want to debug locally, and to do that you need to only run the tests that knapsack runs in the relevant shard, in the right order. Here&rsquo;s how to do that!</p>
