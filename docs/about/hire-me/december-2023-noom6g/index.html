	<h2>Will Jessop</h2>

	<article>
		<p>I am Will Jessop, a programmer, sysadmin, and technical leader with a focus on Ruby on Rails performance, application scaling, and Postgres optimization. I am currently open to new contracts in all these areas.</p>
<p>I am the current (now part time) CTO at Impactive where I tackled urgent scaling and re-architecting challenges, playing a key role in handling the traffic for the Biden campaign in 2020. This involved significantly optimizing Postgres database usage, introducing performance monitoring, and re-architecting systems for scalability. My efforts led to successful handling of peak traffic during the midterm elections in 2020 and then the mid-term elections in 2022 when we peaked at over 1000 req/s.</p>
<p>I also led a complete overhaul of Impactive&rsquo;s engineering department and product pipeline. This re-organization improved project outcomes, engineer focus, and overall happiness, and led to an increase in the quality of the codebase and application. Key initiatives included introducing an eight-week development cycle, restructured meetings, and a new process for assigning work.</p>
<p>During this time I also established a culture of quality by implementing a better code review process, encouraging better Pull Request structuring, and implementing end-to-end testing for critical paths. This led to a significant reduction in bugs and outages, and an increase in engineer confidence and job satisfaction.</p>
<p>In other roles, I have focused on Postgres database performance at Tanda, guided architectural direction and upgrade processes at Procore, and executed seamless Rails upgrades at Stuart. My tenure at 37signals/Basecamp involved security initiatives and sysadmin duties, while at Engineyard, I led customer migrations to AWS and the Terramark cloud.</p>
