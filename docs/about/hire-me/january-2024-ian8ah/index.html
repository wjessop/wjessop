	<h2>I am Will Jessop</h2>

	<article>
		<p>A programmer, technical leader, and sysadmin with a focus on Ruby on Rails performance, application scaling, and <a href="https://willj.net/tags/performance/">Postgres optimization</a>. I am currently open to new contracts in all these areas.</p>
<p>I am the current (now part time) CTO at <a href="https://www.impactive.io/">Impactive</a> where I tackled urgent scaling and re-architecting challenges, playing a key role in handling the traffic for the Biden campaign in 2020. This involved significantly optimizing Postgres database usage, introducing performance monitoring, and re-architecting systems for scalability. My efforts led to successful handling of peak traffic during the midterm elections in 2020 and then the mid-term elections in 2022 when we peaked at over 1000 req/s to the Ruby on Rails application.</p>
<p>I also led a complete overhaul of Impactive&rsquo;s engineering department and product pipeline. This re-organization improved project outcomes, engineer focus, and overall happiness, and led to an increase in the quality of the codebase and application. Key initiatives included introducing an eight-week development cycle, restructured meetings, and a new process for assigning work.</p>
<p>During this time I also established a culture of quality by implementing a better code review process, encouraging better Pull Request structuring, and implementing end-to-end testing for critical paths. This led to a significant reduction in bugs and outages, and an increase in engineer confidence and job satisfaction.</p>
<p>In other roles, I have focused on Postgres database performance at <a href="https://www.tanda.co/">Tanda</a>, guided architectural direction and upgrade processes at <a href="https://www.procore.com/">Procore</a>, and executed seamless Rails upgrades at <a href="https://stuart.com/">Stuart</a>. My tenure at <a href="https://37signals.com/">37signals</a>/<a href="https://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a> involved security initiatives and sysadmin duties, while at <a href="https://www.engineyard.com/">Engineyard</a>, I led customer migrations to AWS and the Terramark cloud.</p>
