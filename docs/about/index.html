		Do you have a Ruby on Rails application you'd like to be faster, more scalable, or just upgraded safely?
		I'm currently open to new contracts doing Ruby on Rails and Postgres scaling and performance work, and Rails upgrades.
		Contact me at <a href="mailto:will@willj.net?subject=Contract%20opportunity">will@willj.net</a> to get started.

					<p>I am Will Jessop, a programmer, sysadmin, and technical leader with a focus on Ruby on Rails performance, application scaling, and Postgres optimization.
I am the current (now part time) CTO at Impactive where I tackled urgent scaling and re-architecting challenges, playing a key role in handling the traffic for the Biden campaign in 2020. This involved significantly optimizing Postgres database usage, introducing performance monitoring, and re-architecting systems for scalability. My efforts led to successful handling of peak traffic during the midterm elections in 2022 and then the mid-terms in 2022 when we peaked at over 1000 req/s.</p>

					<p>Hi, I am Will Jessop, an extensively experienced programmer, sysadmin and technical leader. As a consultant and contractor I focus on:-
Ruby on Rails performance and application scaling. Postgres database performance and scaling. Application architecture planning and implementation for robustness and scale. Ruby on Rails upgrades, including handling upgrades directly, introducing processes to make upgrades sustainable and documenting changes to help teams split up and handle large upgrades themselves. Consulting on engineering organisation structure and process with the aim of improving project outcomes, engineer focus and happiness, and generally increasing the effectiveness of engineering departments.</p>
