      <title>Converting a wordpress.com dump to Hugo, including images</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are a few &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/tools/migrations/#wordpress&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;official&amp;rdquo; options for migrating wordpress content to Hugo&lt;/a&gt;, but they are all either cumbersome (requiring installing wordpress in docker) or don&amp;rsquo;t handle images. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to spend too much time on this and definitely wanted images to be converted so wrote a quick program to handle the conversion for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/wjessop/wordpress_to_hugo&#34;&gt;I created a somewhat rough, but functional program to do the job&lt;/a&gt; and it was successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The requirements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extracts tags where there are any on the original post and adds them to the front Hugo matter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintains the original post date&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Converts the HTML to Markdown&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintains the directory structure, with images copied to the directory that the post&amp;rsquo;s index.md is in:
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-thing&#34; data-lang=&#34;thing&#34;&gt;basedir/
  content/
    posts/
      Some-post-title/
        index.md
        images/
          post-image-1.jpg
          post-image-2.png
     A-different-post-title/
      index.md
      images/
        post-image-for-this-other-arcicle.jpg
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some caveats:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Posts require some fixup&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a little bit of tweaking that I&amp;rsquo;ve had to do to Hugo front matter or the posts, but the program got me mostly all the way. These things could likely be fixed in the code and it would be worth doing so if I was going to run the program more than once, but I&amp;rsquo;m not so it was faster to fix things up manually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doesn&amp;rsquo;t write the summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to write this manually, but I was only dealiing with 10s of posts. If you want to use this then you might want to add something to generate a summary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doesn&amp;rsquo;t always get the image URLs right in the markdown (but it&amp;rsquo;s easily fixable)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code left a few images URLs in the posts pointing to the old wordpress site. It still copied over the images so it was a really simple find and replace to fix these up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doesn&amp;rsquo;t do any error checking, just panics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn&amp;rsquo;t error so I didn&amp;rsquo;t put in the time to handle errors as it was a one-off program, it worked for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skips image only posts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was delberate, but you might want to add that feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the code got me 90% of the way to where I wanted the posts to get so worked well for what I wanted it to do and I&amp;rsquo;d call it a success. &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/wjessop/wordpress_to_hugo&#34;&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve put the code up on Github&lt;/a&gt;, I likely won&amp;rsquo;t need to run this code again, but if it&amp;rsquo;s useful to you please feel free to submit PRs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Reverting Firefox&#39;s recent URL bar suggestion order change</title>
      <link>https://willj.net/posts/revert-firefox-url-bar-suggestion-order-change/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 11 Sep 2023 17:27:00 +0100</pubDate>

      <guid>https://willj.net/posts/revert-firefox-url-bar-suggestion-order-change/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A recent update to Firefox changed the order of suggestions when you started typing in the URL bar (or &amp;ldquo;address bar&amp;rdquo;). It used to be that you&amp;rsquo;d get recently visited URLs first but the change caused search suggestions to appear first. I almost always navigate to sites I know by typing the first few letters of the domain name and almost never used the search suggestions so this change cause consternation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;full&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/Before.png&#34;
         alt=&#34;A firefox URL bar suggestions dropdown showing suggested searches before recently visited sites&#34;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;h4&gt;The URL bar suggestions after Firefox &amp;#34;Improved&amp;#34; the experience in a recent update and changed the suggestions order&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fearing for the longevity of my down arrow key caused the wear of all the extra pressing to get down to the recently visited URLs section I searched for a solution. It turns out that you can change the order of the suggestions in the config. To do so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open a new Firefox tab&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Type &lt;code&gt;about:config&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accept any warnings (yolo)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Type &lt;code&gt;browser.urlbar.showSearchSuggestionsFirst&lt;/code&gt; into the search field&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Toggle the value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You shouldn&amp;rsquo;t need to restart Firefox for the change to take effect, and should now have your URL history back where it was before the search suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;full&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/After.png&#34;
         alt=&#34;A firefox URL bar with recently visited sites before search suggestions&#34;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;h4&gt;URL bar suggestion order, now fixed&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

      <title>Fitting two hard drives and an SSD in a Dell OptiPlex 7010 USFF</title>

      <guid>https://willj.net/posts/fitting-two-hard-drives-and-an-ssd-in-a-dell-optiplex-7010-usff/</guid>
      <description>&lt;figure class=&#34;right&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/DELL-Optiplex-7010-USFF.jpg&#34;
         alt=&#34;A Dell OptiPlex 7010 Ultra Small Form Factor&#34;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;h4&gt;A Dell OptiPlex 7010 USFF&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently bought a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dell.com/support/manuals/en-ae/optiplex-7010/opti7010_usff/specifications?guid=guid-157e8495-34d3-4efa-ab61-1d9efba4c90e&amp;amp;lang=en-us&#34;&gt;Dell OptiPlex 7010 Ultra Small Form Factor&lt;/a&gt; PC from eBay. I was Intending on squeezing two of the spare Seagate Barracuda 4TB 3.5&amp;quot; hard drives I have in it with an SSD boot disk and installing &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.truenas.com/&#34;&gt;TrueNAS&lt;/a&gt; to use it as a file store. It&amp;rsquo;s a small, quiet machine and should be ideal, but when I was doing my research into what I should buy I think I got the USFF (Ultra Small Form Factor) confused with another Dell OptiPlex machine and it turns out that the USFF model I got can only officially fit a single 2.5&amp;quot; SSD in it, and no 3.5&amp;quot; drives at all. Whoops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opening up the machine it turns out that there was actually a 3.5&amp;quot; drive bay and the eBay seller used a tiny amount of hot glue to just glue a 2.5&amp;quot; SSD into the bay rather than using an adapter. Quality. This didn&amp;rsquo;t help much though, there was still no way of fitting the number of drives I wanted in the machine as it came. Anyway, after removing the SSD, the official Dell drive mounts and the slim CDRW drive I took a look at the situation and figured I could probably rescue this with a bit of 3d printing. Any day that requires you to solve a problem with a bit of 3d printing is generally a good day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;caveat&#34;&gt;Caveat!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This works for my Seagate Barracuda 4TB drives. They&amp;rsquo;re slightly thinner than some of the other drives I&amp;rsquo;ve got, if yours are thicker then it might work for yoiu or it might not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;risers-of-the-machine&#34;&gt;Risers of the Machine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;left&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/Dell-Optiplex-7010-USFF-inside.jpg&#34;
         alt=&#34;View inside a Dell OptiPlex 7010 Ultra Small Form Factor&#34;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;h4&gt;View inside a Dell OptiPlex 7010 USFF, there isn&amp;#39;t much room&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure class=&#34;right&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/Dell-OptiPlex-7010-motherboard.jpg&#34;
         alt=&#34;A Dell OptiPlex 7010 Ultra Small Form Factor motherboard&#34;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;h4&gt;The motherboard. Red circles are candidates for risers, the turquoise square is where the CPU heat sink and fan are&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the existing mounts had been removed I could see that there were four screws holding the motherboard in place, and an existing riser, all of which could be re-purposed as places to screw a riser which would allow me to mount drives suspended over the RAM. See the image where I&amp;rsquo;ve marked the locations of these holes with a red circle. The turquoise square is about where the CPU heatsink and fan are, but the heatsink is low profile and draws the heat towards the back of the machine closer to the IO ports where the fan is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-curse-of-the-imperial-menace&#34;&gt;The Curse of the Imperial Menace!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metric is the best and only measurement system anyone should use, but unfortunately PC manufacturers seem to have settled on imperial for at least the bolt hole sizes I need to use which are &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Thread_Standard&#34;&gt;6-32 UNC&lt;/a&gt;. The risers I need to incorporate into this design are fairly long too at nearly 40mm. That&amp;rsquo;s about M3.5 * 40mm in metric, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find any M3.5 risers of the right height, and I can buy 6-32 UNC bolts on eBay easily enough so I bought some of those. You can probably use M3.5 as a substitute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;to-fusion360&#34;&gt;To Fusion360!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days my 3d designing tool of choice is Fusion 360 so I opened it up and set to work. Much cursing, and a fair few scrapped prototypes later I came up with this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;full&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/Fusion%20360%20design.png&#34;
         alt=&#34;A mount for two 3.5 inch and one 2.5 inch hard drive&#34;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;h4&gt;3d design isn&amp;#39;t my day job&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s definitely not going to win any awards for beautiful design, and it&amp;rsquo;s got some problems, but it works. I could certainly have improved the design further, but I was running out of patience with 3d printing prototypes I had to throw away, and time on my Fusion 360 trial (damn you Autodesk!). Anyway, it&amp;rsquo;s ugly, it&amp;rsquo;s flawed, but it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-finished-mount-in-action&#34;&gt;The finished mount in action&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the first part of the install showing the &amp;ldquo;base&amp;rdquo; of the mount. The SSD is slung underneath with M3 bolts * 12mm, because that was what I had. I should have made the recess for the bolt heads a bit deeper so the bolt heads were further away from the underside of the bottom hard drive, but though it&amp;rsquo;s tight it doesn&amp;rsquo;t touch so I&amp;rsquo;m leaving it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is about 5mm clearance between the bottom of the mount and the RAM, and enough clearance between the SSD and the CPU cooler for wires to pass comfortably. The SSD could be mounted about 5mm higher, closer to the bottom of the first hard drive, but I only had 12mm bolts in M3.5 and so had to print spacers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are captive nuts on the top-left of this image underneath the base, nearest the front of the case. These were exactly the right size for the nuts I was using, which meant that the nuts stayed in right up until I used any force at all on them like when I was trying to screw a bolt into them. This was infuriating so I epoxied the nuts in place. If I was to do another version of this I&amp;rsquo;d make the nut traps tighter so the nuts could be safely held in place with a press fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two bolts you can see with two nuts on them used as spacers, these are a flaw in the design. In order to prevent the 50mm bolts I was using from bottoming out I could have used shorter bolts and printed recesses, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to buy more imperial bolts I was never going to use again. I could have printed spacers, but the nuts worked and they were there. In the end I had to remove one of the nuts from the bottom-left most bolt so it didn&amp;rsquo;t foul the hard drive, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t bottom out even then so it worked out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;full&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/IMG_5160.jpeg&#34;
         alt=&#34;A custom 3d printed HD mount inside the Dell OptiPlex case&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here you can see the 3.5&amp;quot; hard drives in place. There is a gap between the two drives to allow for air flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;full&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/IMG_5161.jpeg&#34;
         alt=&#34;2 hard drives mounted on the fully assembled custom mount&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here you can see how tight it is near the case fan, the tolerances in this design are pretty tight. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t shift the hard drives further away from the front of the case/the case fan because the latch in the removable panel on the case prevents them from moving backwards in the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;full&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/IMG_5164.jpeg&#34;
         alt=&#34;the mounted hard drives very close to the front of the case and the case fan&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The front of the case looking in through the old CDRW slot. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t look like it but there is a mm or two clearance between the top of the top hard drive and the case when the lid is on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;full&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/IMG_5162.jpeg&#34;
         alt=&#34;Hard drives seen through the front of the PC case&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same view but with the lit fitted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;full&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/IMG_5165.jpeg&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;parts-list&#34;&gt;Parts list&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to make this mount exactly as I did then you will need these parts, or metric equivalent. Just bear in mind that it could be improved, so if you&amp;rsquo;ve got access to a 3d design program and the willingness it could be better. Let me know if you release an improved model and I&amp;rsquo;ll link it here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 x 6-32 UNC * 50mm bolts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5 x 6-32 UNC nuts (or 2 x if you print out spacers for the risers, see first image and description in &amp;ldquo;The finished mount in action&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 x M3 * 12mm flat head bolts for the SSD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10 x standard HD mounting screws (8 for the HDs, 2 for the base)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SATA cables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A SATA power splitter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SSD bolts looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;full&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/IMG_5238.jpeg&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;printing-instructions&#34;&gt;Printing instructions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The design is printed in parts. Print one each of all parts you see in the image above, except you&amp;rsquo;ll need four of the risers (the long thing sticking down on the bottom left of the image) and four of the SSD mounting spacers if you&amp;rsquo;re using the same m3 bolts as me. Adjust or omit these if you have different length M3 bolts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any 3d printer should work, but all this was printed on a Prusa i3 MK3S, if you&amp;rsquo;re looking for your own 3d printer then the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.prusa3d.com/category/original-prusa-mk4/&#34;&gt;Prusa i3 MK4&lt;/a&gt; would be a great option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;things-id-do-differently&#34;&gt;Things I&amp;rsquo;d do differently&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The HD Screws aren&amp;rsquo;t really long enough for going through a nut and two layers of 3d print, so where I&amp;rsquo;ve used them to connect the base of the mount the print is a little thin to allow for all the thread to pass through and bite into the thread in the nut. I could have used different screws/bolts or could likely have done this without any screws at all with an interlocking design, but this works and I don&amp;rsquo;t want to re-design it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make the SSD mounting bolt head recesses very slightly deeper.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Made the nut traps tighter, the nuts were loose which made installation a pain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Re-designed to use less 3d printing and to take advantage of the HDs inherant stiffness. The HDs are made of metal, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t need anywhere near as much 3d printed structure to keep them in place, I could have relied on the inherant stiffness of the drives more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Made the risers tighter so they didn&amp;rsquo;t fall off the long bolts on installation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Made the base installable first then the HDs bolt onto that, as it stands there&amp;rsquo;s a fiddly installation process and you have to remove pretty much the whole thing to change a drive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The riser closest to the power button interferes with the HD if you offset it from the base the correct amount, I&amp;rsquo;d re-design that (see first picture and description under &amp;ldquo;The finished mount in action&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;things-to-test-later&#34;&gt;Things to test later&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve fully assembled the mount, powered it on, installed TrueNAS and started using it as a file store, so it works. A couple of things I&amp;rsquo;d like to test at some point but haven&amp;rsquo;t got round to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;heat&#34;&gt;Heat&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding more things into the case means less airflow. I think there&amp;rsquo;s still enough (below the mount, round the side near the case fan, between the hard drives) that it&amp;rsquo;s not going to overheat, but I&amp;rsquo;ll be monitoring the heat using the TrueNAS UI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;power-usage&#34;&gt;Power usage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PSU is 64W I think, but seems to be fine driving two mirrored 5400 RPM drives and an SSD. I left my power monitor on my boat though so will test when I get the chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;downloads&#34;&gt;Downloads&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fusion 360 design file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;Dell%20Optiplex%207010%20USFF%20HD%20Mount.f3d&#34;&gt;Dell Optiplex 7010 USFF HD Mount.f3d&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;STL:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;stl/Base.stl&#34;&gt;Base&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;stl/Front%20top.stl&#34;&gt;Front top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;stl/Back%20top.stl&#34;&gt;Back top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;stl/Riser.stl&#34;&gt;Riser&lt;/a&gt; (print x 4)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;stl/SSD%20Offset.stl&#34;&gt;SSD Offset&lt;/a&gt; (print x 4)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve said it before, but it&amp;rsquo;s worth repeating. This mount works just fine, the drives are well fixed in place, the cables stay in, the case lid closes. However, designing stuff isn&amp;rsquo;t my day job and this design has a number of issues that if someone with more time and who is better at 3d design wanted to build on then it could be greatly improved. If I were to print a new version of this I&amp;rsquo;d probably alter the design quite a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that said, if you want to print this, and have the parts, then I don&amp;rsquo;t see any reason why it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t also work for you, it&amp;rsquo;s working for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me know if you use this or improve it! Contact details on &lt;a href=&#34;https://willj.net/&#34;&gt;the homepage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Random graph, from playing around with &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/monora/rgl&#34;&gt;RGL&lt;/a&gt; in Ruby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;full&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://willjessop4.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/959tvax.jpg&#34;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Say you have a graph like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;full&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/graph.jpg&#34;
         alt=&#34;a simple graph&#34;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;h4&gt;A simple graph&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you find out if there is a path between any of the two nodes? By using a breadth-first search:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-ruby&#34; data-lang=&#34;ruby&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;require &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;rgl/implicit&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;require &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;rgl/traversal&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;vertices &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;one&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;two&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;three&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;g &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;RGL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;ImplicitGraph&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;new &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;g&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  g&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;vertex_iterator { &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; vertices&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;map{&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;v&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; b&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;call(v) } }
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  g&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;adjacent_iterator { &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;x, b&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; b&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;call( vertices&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;(vertices&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;index(x) &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;abs&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; ) }

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m making a simple camera gimbal and tonight I wired up the right analog stick on my xbox controller to control the pan/tilt servos:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/C8RJzWzkW0c&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow I will print out a prototype gimbal structure.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of ruby one-liners for dumping out the content of a github commit hook payload:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For hooks that use type &lt;strong&gt;application/json&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For hooks that use type &lt;strong&gt;application/x-www-form-urlencoded&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>AWS IAM Policy for allowing s3cmd to sync to an S3 bucket</title>

      <guid>https://willj.net/posts/aws-iam-policy-for-allowing-s3cmd-to-sync-to-an-s3-bucket/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a good idea to set an IAM access policy for anything that accesses AWS using your account details, I wanted to do this for s3cmd syncing a local directory to an s3 bucket. There are a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=s3cmd+iam+policy&amp;amp;oq=s3cmd+iam&amp;amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i57j69i60.4378j0j7&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;es_sm=91&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&#34;&gt;number of posts&lt;/a&gt; on setting up the IAM policy for s3cmd already but none of the examples worked for me, I got a 403 permission denied error when running the s3cmd sync command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some digging it turns out that s3cmd now tries to set an ACL on the files it uploads, and this needs to be specifically allowed in the ACL. I&amp;rsquo;m guessing that it didn&amp;rsquo;t in the past, hence the now incorrect IAM advice. So here is the new working IAM policy, complete with the &lt;code&gt;s3:PutObjectAcl&lt;/code&gt; permission added:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(See jrantil&amp;rsquo;s comment below on wether &lt;code&gt;s3:ListAllMyBuckets&lt;/code&gt; is needed in this instance)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-json&#34; data-lang=&#34;json&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;{
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Version&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;2012-10-17&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;      ],

      <title>Prototype lifter arm</title>
      <link>https://willj.net/posts/prototype-lifter-arm/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I added a prototype lifter arm to my robot yesterday. It needs re-doing (it&amp;rsquo;s unreliable and heavy) but it works for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m using a new motor driver circuit for it as I burned out the SN754410 motor driver I was using, the lifter motor seems to peak briefly at about 1.5 amps when starting to lift the arm, and that&amp;rsquo;s out of the chips range. I stayed up late making a new motor control circuit with a L298N that can provide a lot more power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the robot picking up 12 ping-pong balls. I was driving, Morwenna was filming:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/doxEBi1UjLg&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the same run seen through the on-board camera. Almost all of the run was done watching the live feed rather than watching the robot itself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/T1NwjBEUjio&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the paper strip-board design for the L298N circuit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&#34;full&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://willjessop4.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/img_4440.jpg&#34;

        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

            &lt;h4&gt;The finished circuit. You can see it bolted to the back of the robot in the video.&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;

      <title>First robot remote driving test</title>
      <link>https://willj.net/posts/first-robot-remote-driving-test/</link>

      <guid>https://willj.net/posts/first-robot-remote-driving-test/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I programmed some remote control software using a Golang receiving program on the robot and a ruby control client using my &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/wjessop/gamepad&#34;&gt;gamepad ruby gem&lt;/a&gt; and an Xbox 1 controller. It worked OK. It was a bit jerky, there&amp;rsquo;s no PWM so no acceleration, it&amp;rsquo;s either go or stop; anything not totally rigid on the robot wobbles. Also the position of the camera doesn&amp;rsquo;t show enough of the robot so it&amp;rsquo;s hard to get a real idea of where the robot is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was filming, the robot was being controlled my my wife, Morwenna, from upstairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/4YYC7bCiRTI&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The robot is also prone to shed a track if the &amp;ldquo;half turn&amp;rdquo; is used too much, that is one track forwards or backwards, the other one stationary. I can fix this in software if I can work out a way to do PWM on the robot that doesn&amp;rsquo;t run the Raspberry Pi CPU.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New robot base design and completed prototype arm assembly</title>
      <link>https://willj.net/posts/new-robot-base-design-and-completed-prototype-arm-assembly/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2013 13:16:49 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://willj.net/posts/new-robot-base-design-and-completed-prototype-arm-assembly/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I spent all day at &lt;a href=&#34;http://hacman.org.uk/&#34;&gt;hacman&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday and Wednesday printing and tweaking robot parts. I put it all together when I got home. This is the front, the lifter arm has holes to allow me to screw in different attachments, I&amp;rsquo;ve still not designed that part of the robot yet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;full&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/img_4432.jpg&#34;
         alt=&#34;The robot, mostly assembled&#34;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;h4&gt;The robot, mostly assembled&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the back view, you can see the lifter arm gear housing (the curved structure) and the motor that drives it, also the battery (underneath the ball hopper)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;full&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/img_4433.jpg&#34;
         alt=&#34;The rear of the robot with the hopper in place&#34;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;h4&gt;The rear of the robot with the hopper in place&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lifter arm gear system looking through where the hopper would be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;full&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/img_4434.jpg&#34;
         alt=&#34;The robot without the hopper in place&#34;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;h4&gt;The robot without the hopper in place&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need to design an attachment for the end of the lifter arm. Here I&amp;rsquo;ve created a simple one using meccano. It&amp;rsquo;s too heavy, the bolts catch on the floor and it dumps the ping-pong balls short of the hopper. Other than that it&amp;rsquo;s perfect. You can see the camera with capped lens that I&amp;rsquo;ve just wedged into the structure temporarily:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;full&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/img_44351.jpg&#34;
         alt=&#34;A prototype lifter arm made from meccano, attached to the robot&#34;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;h4&gt;A prototype lifter arm made from Meccano&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next-up&lt;/strong&gt;: better lifter attachment design, a couple of re-prints with tweaks and some software.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;First test of the Raspberry Pi running off battery power with no external supply at all. In the picture the 5000mAh battery is the object at the back with &amp;ldquo;5000&amp;rdquo; written on it. My multimeter is measuring the voltage output. One of the Raspberry Pi (the thing with the red light on it) output pins is connected through the MotorPiTX board (the yellow circuit board on-top of the Raspberry Pi) to the breadboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The breadboard contains two circuits, the top-right cluster of components is the circuit that turns the output of the Raspberry Pi into something relevant to the motor driver in the bottom left, the bottom left cluster of components is the motor driver itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pi is pulsing the output causing the motor driver to spin the motor. The micro-switch just on the very bottom of the picture is one of the limit switches for the ball lifter arm.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I printed out and glued together the first iteration of the ping-pong ball hopper that takes up most of the space of the robot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;full&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/img_4405.jpg&#34;
         alt=&#34;The assembled hopper&#34;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;h4&gt;The assembled hopper&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full of ping-pong balls, I can get 12-14 in without packing them manually. That seems like enough for now, but a larger hopper would be good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;full&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/img_4406.jpg&#34;
         alt=&#34;The hopper loaded with ping-pong balls&#34;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;h4&gt;The hopper loaded with ping-pong balls&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mounted on the robot. You can see the completed camera mount and Raspberry Pi mounted on the side in the foreground:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;full&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/img_4407.jpg&#34;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I needed to re-design the motor mounts on the robot base, they didn&amp;rsquo;t hold the motors securely enough and tended to shift around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new mounts are better fitting and include a small wedge that fits between one of the gearbox plates where there are no cogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;full&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/img_4404.jpg&#34;
         alt=&#34;Two small motors with in-built gearboxes in motor mounts&#34;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;h4&gt;You can see the small gearboxes built in to the motors&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure class=&#34;full&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/img_4403.jpg&#34;
         alt=&#34;Two motors fully encased in the motor mounts&#34;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;h4&gt;The new motor mounts are a snug fit&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the great things about 3d printing is being able to pull out part of a design and iterate over in isolation, then when you&amp;rsquo;re done incorporate it back into your main design.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I printed out the front half of my Raspberry Pi camera module mount. It serves two purposes, providing a way of mounting the camera on my robot, and giving me a place to attach the wide-angle lens I&amp;rsquo;d bought earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h4&gt;Testing the robot power requirements&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I pick a battery I need to know what power requirements my robot is going to have so I took it into the &lt;a href=&#34;http://hacman.org.uk/&#34;&gt;hackspace&lt;/a&gt; to test. I hooked it up to one of the power supplies then ran all the systems, so Streaming video off the Raspberry Pi over wireless whilst running the motors. I weight it down with a large motor (the big black thing) and then provided resistance, it peaks at about 1.6 amps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the video you can also see the new side mounted Raspberry Pi and the base of the ping-pong ball hopper.&lt;/p&gt;
