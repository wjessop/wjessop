<p>It&rsquo;s very nice Will, but why?</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
<p><img src="images//blue_snowball_1.jpg#right" alt="Blue Snowball microphone in the way of my monitor"></p>
<p>I inherited a unwanted Blue Snowball from <a href="https://37signals.com/">an old employer</a> several years ago, and it&rsquo;s been a really fantastic addition to my day to day kit, especially as the number of video calls has increased in recent years. The only problem I had with the microphone started when I upgraded my monitors to some portrait orientation screens. These come almost all the way down to the desk, and as a result the (in my opinion rather ugly) original Blue Snowball microphone stand rather got in the way, even at it&rsquo;s shortest setting.</p>

<p><img src="images//blue_snowball_2.jpg#right" alt="Blue Snowball microphone lying on it&rsquo;s side"></p>
<p>I was able to &ldquo;fix&rdquo; the problem of the microphone being in the way by laying the microphone flat. This wasn&rsquo;t ideal, it took up a lot more room, looked bad, and made it sound like I was lying down. Still, it worked for long enough.</p>
<h2 id="the-solution">The Solution</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m always looking for a problem where the solution is &ldquo;3D print something&rdquo;, and this seemed like a perfect fit. An hour with Fusion 360 later and I had a stand I liked.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m really happy with it, it fulfils all the criteria I had when I started designing it, and I&rsquo;m particularly happy with the way it looks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is as minimalistic as possible. I don&rsquo;t want clutter.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s also fairly elegant in terms of looks (in my opinion of course), I have to look at this thing every day.</li>
<li>Fits the screw threads on the Blue Snowball mic. I want to position it myself and don&rsquo;t want it swivelling around if a cable gets nudged.</li>
<li>Rises as low as possible above the desk. I don&rsquo;t want it blocking the view of my monitors.</li>
<li>Allows room for the microphone to be tilted without the cable fouling on the desk.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="print-one-yourself">Print one yourself</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve uploaded the STL files for you to print yourself. There&rsquo;s the <a href="files/blue_snowball_desk_stand/Blue%20snowball%20desk%20stand%20v3.stl">v3 design</a> which is the one I use, and the <a href="files/blue_snowball_desk_stand/Blue%20snowball%20desk%20stand%20v5.stl">v5 design</a>. The two versions are very similar, the difference is only that the v3 version has a curved underside, and the v5 version has been designed to not require a support structure while printing. V3 is my preferred version and is probably less prone to wobble.</p>
<p>If you are printing these yourself due to the fine thread you will likely want to use a fairly high quality print setting.</p>
