	<h2>Should I switch from Sendgrid to Amazon SES?</h2>

	<article>
		<p><strong>Update: A new comparison with updated Sendgrid prices, and Postmark is available <a href="/posts/cloud-email-service-price-comparison">here</a> &ldquo;Sendgrid, Postmark and Amazon SES price comparison&rdquo;).</strong></p>
<p>Probably yes, at least if price is your main concern and you are just concerned with sending email and not with extras. I wanted to see just how the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ses/">Amazon SES</a> prices stacked up against (that I am aware of) the next cheapest provider, <a href="http://sendgrid.com/">Sendgrid</a> so I graphed it:</p>
<figure class="full"><img src="images/emails-price-comparison1.png"
         alt="A graph showing the difference between prices for Sendgrid and AWS SES"/><figcaption>
            <h4>Cost comparison for Amazon SES/Sendgrid</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>SendGrid can&rsquo;t be too happy with that, in short at no point is it better to go with SendGrid over SES if you are only taking price into account. Of course SendGrid have <a href="https://sendgrid.com/pricing/">value-add over just plain email</a> sending, you decide if it&rsquo;s worth the premium, but for me the only feature I&rsquo;d want would be the &lsquo;Whitelabel&rsquo; option, and Amazon SES has that included.</p>
<p>Note that you get 2000 emails per day free with Amazon SES if you send from an <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Amazon EC2</a> instance, but at this scale there is very little visible difference in cost. I thought it would be useful to take into account the cost of an EC2 instance, even if you have your main server elsewhere you could run your email processing on a micro or small EC2 machine to take advantage of the 2000 free emails per day, here&rsquo;s a zoom in on the origin:</p>
<figure class="full"><img src="images/email-prices-plus-server.png"
         alt="A graph showing the difference between prices for Sendgrid and AWS SES, including spinning up a server to send mail from"/><figcaption>
            <h4>Cost comparison for Amazon SES/Sendgrid &#43; EC2 instance cost</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>So, there is no point in spinning up an EC2 instance to take advantage of the 2000 free emails per day.</p>
<p>I will be interested in SendGrid&rsquo;s response to this. Possibly lowering prices? For me certainly their value-add isn&rsquo;t worth the extra cost over Amazon SES.</p>
