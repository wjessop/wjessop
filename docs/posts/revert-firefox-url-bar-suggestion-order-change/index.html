	<h2>Reverting Firefox&#39;s recent URL bar suggestion order change</h2>

	<article>
		<p>A recent update to Firefox changed the order of suggestions when you started typing in the URL bar (or &ldquo;address bar&rdquo;). It used to be that you&rsquo;d get recently visited URLs first but the change caused search suggestions to appear first. I almost always navigate to sites I know by typing the first few letters of the domain name and almost never used the search suggestions so this change cause consternation.</p>

      <h4>The URL bar suggestions after Firefox &#34;Improved&#34; the experience in a recent update and changed the suggestions order</h4>

<p>Fearing for the longevity of my down arrow key caused the wear of all the extra pressing to get down to the recently visited URLs section I searched for a solution. It turns out that you can change the order of the suggestions in the config. To do so:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open a new Firefox tab</li>
<li>Type <code>about:config</code></li>
<li>Accept any warnings (yolo)</li>
<li>Type <code>browser.urlbar.showSearchSuggestionsFirst</code> into the search field</li>
<li>Toggle the value</li>
</ol>
<p>You shouldn&rsquo;t need to restart Firefox for the change to take effect, and should now have your URL history back where it was before the search suggestions.</p>
