	<h2>New robot base design and completed prototype arm assembly</h2>

	<article>
		<p>I spent all day at <a href="http://hacman.org.uk/">hacman</a>Â Tuesday and Wednesday printing and tweaking robot parts. I put it all together when I got home. This is the front, the lifter arm has holes to allow me to screw in different attachments, I&rsquo;ve still not designed that part of the robot yet:</p>

</figure>

<p>Here is the back view, you can see the lifter arm gear housing (the curved structure) and the motor that drives it, also the battery (underneath the ball hopper)</p>
<figure class="full"><img src="images/img_4433.jpg"

            <h4>The rear of the robot with the hopper in place</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The lifter arm gear system looking through where the hopper would be:</p>

            <h4>The robot without the hopper in place</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I need to design an attachment for the end of the lifter arm. Here I&rsquo;ve created a simple one using meccano. It&rsquo;s too heavy, the bolts catch on the floor and it dumps the ping-pong balls short of the hopper. Other than that it&rsquo;s perfect. You can see the camera with capped lens that I&rsquo;ve just wedged into the structure temporarily:</p>

</figure>

<p><strong>Next-up</strong>: better lifter attachment design, a couple of re-prints with tweaks and some software.</p>
