	<h2>Will&#39;s YouTube sailing channel recommendations</h2>

	<article>
		<p>I started watching YouTube sailing videos in about 2014 when I discovered <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZdQjaSoLjIzFnWsDQOv4ww">Sailing la Vagabonde</a>. I&rsquo;d never really considered that sailing was something I could be interested in, I didn&rsquo;t know anything about it at all. I remember being on holiday with my wife in Greece a few times and seeing sailing yachts moored up in the harbours, and I think there was a curiosity about the boats, and the people eating what I probably assumed were fancy lunches on them. I must have seen yachts in the sea, or in harbours or marinas, but I don&rsquo;t really remember. They were just part of the view, not something to be interacted with. A different world. Billionaire bosses and boat shoes.</p>
<p>Anyway, I ignored sailing, and sailing ignored me, until one day a cooking show I watched linked to la Vagabonde. I was suddenly given a peek behind the curtain, a view into a previously unknown world and I was pretty curious, so I kept watching. These people seemedâ€¦ normal, approachable. I started to consume the la Vagabonde back catalogue, and was curious if there were more people making these videos. A quick google later and I&rsquo;d found Delos, and after a couple of tries (their early videos were hard to get through) I started working my way through their back catalogue too, and so started my interest in sailing that has lasted 8 years, and has now seen us buy <a href="https://sailingsilvergirl.com">our own boat</a>.</p>
<p>Over those years I&rsquo;ve gathered a number of YouTube subscriptions and figured I&rsquo;d share them here, save people having to dig through the less great content out there to find some gems.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/svdelos">SV Delos</a> - Try to push through the earlier videos, this one of the most widely respected sailing channels out there, but the early videos don&rsquo;t do them justice.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SailLife">Sail Life</a> - First several years are a re-fit (which was very well filmed and I loved), but they&rsquo;re sailing now.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLYd5EnTTwUKhouIkHoqzMw">Ran Sailing</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXbWsGV_cjG3gOsSnNJPVlg">Sailing Uma</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-e4fYEUg2tVQ0NGL9oD1RQ">Sailing Millennial Falcon</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUH6fLsV6J7WKEmf7vJKfAw">Erik Aanderaa</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkExLY1E6CE-GPsMCdSjmxQ">Sailing Yacht Florence</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCF45qzioJ_0FVdZVG2NJTWg">Sailing Project Atticus</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS6qLhh5YBeL42HRMh3dc1A">Christian Williams</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBczX15IcXx0OqhqwlUtJjw">Sailing cos I love it</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTmJcC_Yw3IL7Bvtf_7nTLw">How to Sail Oceans</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SailingSweetRuca">Sailing Sweet Ruca</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGFbz7qMXCm28EPCkZWSMKg">Calico Skies Sailing</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SailingMagicCarpet">Magic Carpet</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/parlayrevival">Parlay Revival</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZdQjaSoLjIzFnWsDQOv4ww">Sailing La Vagabonde</a> - I don&rsquo;t watch them as much anymore, they do a lot less stuff I&rsquo;m interested in.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/gonewiththewynns">Gone with the Wynns</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRqsOR0Y2zru-jXSzLcMcxg">Sailing Soulianis</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE4vct4tqxSuG4JH6vMVZSA">Sam Holmes Sailing</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvJGfEEg7R04-ifkg_FFnaw">MJ Sailing</a> - Currently doing a rather dry, no pun untended, boat build, but see old videos.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCT9U1fPkHj0mJjC4LWGH26g">Sailing Kittiwake</a> - They seem to have stopped posting now</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9rRsBE2nFbnUSjtmv6Jq6w">Sailing Ruby Rose</a> - Currently rather dry Catamaran videos, but the earlier stuff was good.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these are pure sailing, some more &ldquo;lifestyle&rdquo; sailing. I like each for different reasons. Some I tolerate and only watch when I&rsquo;ve run out of other stuff, but see what you like. Bear in mind not everything these people do is a good idea, but it&rsquo;s a pretty easy way of immersing yourself in the scene without any outlay.</p>
