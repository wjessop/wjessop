	<h2>Effective Github Notifications</h2>

	<p>Taming the torrent of Github notification emails</p>

	<article>
		<p>Github notifications can be overwhelming, but with effective email filtering they can be turned from an encumbrance to being highly valuable. Here&rsquo;s some filters to get you started (in Mail.app on a mac) to make them more useful.</p>
<p>Luckily Github provides us with the tools to make this filtering relatively easy. All email notifications sent from Github are automatically CCed to a Github email address that describes what they are, and this is the hook we use to create our filters.</p>
<p>All email addresses here are @github.com, even though in some examples they are hidden, and these rules can be added to the GMail web UI too if needed.</p>

<p>Mark <strong>assignments</strong>, <strong>review requests</strong>, <strong>mentions</strong> or <strong>author actions</strong> as high priority and flag them. This will put them at the top of your inbox:</p>

<p><strong>Comments</strong>, <strong>your activity</strong>, and when a <strong>team mentions</strong> you are in is mentioned.</p>

<h2 id="hide-low-priority-notifications">Hide low priority notifications</h2>
<p>Things you might want to go and check once in a while but aren&rsquo;t directly involved in we can put in a folder so they don&rsquo;t demand attention throughout the day.</p>

<p>What you should end up with after doing this is an inbox that shows you all the things that need your attention or you&rsquo;d be interested, but hides the everyday torrent of Github spam in a folder that you can check if you want later.</p>
