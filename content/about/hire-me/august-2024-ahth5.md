A programmer, technical leader, and sysadmin with a focus on Ruby on Rails performance, application scaling, and [Postgres optimization](https://willj.net/tags/performance/). I am currently open to new contracts in all these areas.

I am the current (now part time) CTO at [Impactive](https://www.impactive.io/) where I tackled urgent scaling and re-architecting challenges, playing a pivotal role in handling the traffic for the Biden campaign in 2020 then the mid-term elections in 2022 when we peaked at over 1000 req/s to the Ruby on Rails application. This involved significantly optimizing Postgres database usage, introducing performance monitoring, and re-architecting systems for scalability.

I also led a complete overhaul of Impactive's engineering department and product pipeline. This re-organization improved project outcomes, engineer focus, and overall happiness, and led to an increase in the quality of the codebase and application. Key initiatives included introducing an eight-week development cycle, restructured meetings, and a new process for assigning work.

During this time I also established a culture of quality by implementing a better code review process, encouraging better Pull Request structuring, and implementing end-to-end testing for critical paths. This led to a significant reduction in bugs and outages, and an increase in engineer confidence and job satisfaction.

In other roles, I have focused on Postgres database performance at [Tanda](https://www.tanda.co/), guided architectural direction and upgrade processes at [Procore](https://www.procore.com/) (via [Rubytune](https://rubytune.com)), and executed seamless Rails upgrades at [Stuart](https://stuart.com/). My tenure at [37signals](https://37signals.com/)/[Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/) involved security initiatives and sysadmin duties, while at [Engineyard](https://www.engineyard.com/), I led customer migrations to AWS and the Terramark cloud.

I also have some [Rails core commits](https://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/will-jessop/commits).

			<p>At Collabor8Online, we started having problems - the good kind.  Our client base was growing, and with that growth the database was starting to creak.  Will calmly listened to our situation, discounted our more outlandish potential solutions and gave us some solid, actionable advice.  We implemented the first of these, getting our customers back on side and now we have a plan for scaling the technology as the business continues its growth.</p>
      <p>Will knows his stuff, always favours the simple solution over the complex and is honest and helpful to the end.</p>
