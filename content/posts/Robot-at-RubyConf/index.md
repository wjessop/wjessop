I took my robot to [RubyConf](http://rubyconf.org/). It's not really Ruby related, but I figured it would go down like a robot at a programmers conference… So I took the robot apart, packed it away and headed to Miami:

First job, putting the robot back together again. I was happy it made it through security. It was the first time I'd flown with a small toolkit.

It worked well on the shiny floor of the lobby. You can just about see the new 3d printed lifter arm:

Totally coincidentally Ron Evans also did a great talk on [Artoo](http://artoo.io/) and the newly announced [Gobotio](http://gobot.io/).

Programmers love robots!
