I bought a new hard disc. It probably doesn't work anymore, but then it did only cost me Â£5.20. I don't care what anyone says, I like it. It is hanging behind my desk at work.

Here is the eBay description:

> 14" hard disk platter from the 1970s
>
> From the days when programmers didn't eat quiche!
>
> This platter from a hard disk drive came from a Hull University mainframe in 1978. The disk is 14 inches (35.5cm) in diameter and 1.5mm thick.
>
> It is made from a hard aluminium alloy coated with magnetic material. One side is covered with a random collection of supermarket price and product labels of the period. Even though it has been used as a rather lethal frisbee, it is still perfectly flat.

And here are some photos:
