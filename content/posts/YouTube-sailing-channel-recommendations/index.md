I started watching YouTube sailing videos in about 2014 when I discovered [Sailing la Vagabonde](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZdQjaSoLjIzFnWsDQOv4ww). I'd never really considered that sailing was something I could be interested in, I didn't know anything about it at all. I remember being on holiday with my wife in Greece a few times and seeing sailing yachts moored up in the harbours, and I think there was a curiousity about the boats, and the people eating what I probably assumed were fancy lunches on them. I must have seen yachts in the sea, or in harbours or marinas, but I don't really remember. They were just part of the view, not somehing to be interacted with. A different world. Billionaire bosses and boat shoes.

Anyway, I ignored sailing, and sailing ignored me, until one day a cooking show I watched linked to la Vagabonde. I was suddenly given a peek behind the curtain, a view into a previously unknown world and I was pretty curious, so I kept watching. These people seemedâ€¦ normal, approachable. I started to consume the la Vagabonde back catalogue, and was curious if there were more people making these videos. A quick google later and I'd found Delos, and after a couple of tries (their early videos were hard to get through) I started working my way through their back catalogue too, and so started my interest in sailing that has lasted 8 years, and has now seen us buy [our own boat](https://sailingsilvergirl.com).

Over those years I've gathered a number of YouTube subscriptions and figured I'd share them here, save people having to dig through the less great content out there to find some gems.

- [SV Delos](https://www.youtube.com/c/svdelos) - Try to push through the earlier videos, this one of the most widely respected sailing channels out there, but the early videos don't do them justice.
- [Ran Sailing](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLYd5EnTTwUKhouIkHoqzMw)
- [Sailing Uma](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXbWsGV_cjG3gOsSnNJPVlg)
- [Sailing Millennial Falcon](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-e4fYEUg2tVQ0NGL9oD1RQ)
- [Erik Aanderaa](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUH6fLsV6J7WKEmf7vJKfAw)
- [Sailing Yacht Florence](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkExLY1E6CE-GPsMCdSjmxQ)

- [Calico Skies Sailing](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGFbz7qMXCm28EPCkZWSMKg)
- [Magic Carpet](https://www.youtube.com/c/SailingMagicCarpet)
- [Parlay Revival](https://www.youtube.com/c/parlayrevival)
- [Sailing La Vagabonde](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZdQjaSoLjIzFnWsDQOv4ww) - I don't watch them as much anymore, they do a lot less stuff I'm interested in.
- [Gone with the Wynns](https://www.youtube.com/user/gonewiththewynns)
- [Sailing Soulianis](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRqsOR0Y2zru-jXSzLcMcxg)
- [Sam Holmes Sailing](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE4vct4tqxSuG4JH6vMVZSA)
- [MJ Sailing](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvJGfEEg7R04-ifkg_FFnaw) - Currently doing a rather dry, no pun untended, boat build, but see old videos.
- [Sailing Kittiwake](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCT9U1fPkHj0mJjC4LWGH26g) - They seem to have stopped posting now
- [Sailing Ruby Rose](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9rRsBE2nFbnUSjtmv6Jq6w) - Currently rather dry Catamaran videos, but the earlier stuff was good.

Some of these are pure sailing, some more "lifestyle" sailing. I like each for different reasons. Some I tolerate and only watch when I've run out of other stuff, but see what you like. Bear in mind not everything these people do is a good idea, but it's a pretty easy way of immersing yourself in the scene without any outlay.
