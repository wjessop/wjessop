Some of these are pure sailing, some more "lifestyle" sailing. I like each for different reasons. Some I tolerate and only watch when I've run out of other stuff, but see what you like. Bear in mind not everything these people do is a good idea, but it's a pretty easy way of immersing yourself in the scene without any outlay.
