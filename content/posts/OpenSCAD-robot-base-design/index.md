I've re-designed a prototype robot mount in OpenSCAD as Sketchup wasn't up to the job. It took a while, you have to program the model in a text editor so there's lots of trial and error. Will have to wait to print it to see if this design will work.

I've made some improvements over the [original design](/posts/designing-a-track-mount), most notably thicker side walls and motor mounts, more accurate measurements and added the cross-pieces with a Raspberry Pi mount. Here's the original Sketchup design for comparison:

Sketchup was great, really easy to use, the only problem was that it seemed to create invalid model files.
