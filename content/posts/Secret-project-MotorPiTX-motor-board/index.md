I soldered together my MotorPiTX motor controller today and fitted it to the robot:

It's a hell of a lot neater than my original effort, and only trails one wire. It goes forwards _and_ backwards now too. To the left of the blue relay near the top you can see my homemade heatsink attached to the voltage regulator:

The robot in action, being driven by a Go program on the Raspberry Pi:

Next up, getting the camera working, and figuring out a better power supply/battery.
