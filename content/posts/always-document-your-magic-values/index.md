- Having to write down documentation for the value makes you think about the value more, forces you to justify it.

Chestertons fence
Many programmers know this instinctively

Marina story, also instinctive?

Sometimes using the defaults can be documentable too, why did you choose the default? I prefer explicitly stating the value and why it was chosen.

Documenting no decision taken might be possible. No decision made on retry, will leave it to sidekiq etc. Better than no docs.
