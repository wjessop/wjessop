# Introducing, an all-new, super-sleek Blue Snowball microphone desk stand!

It's very nice Will, but why?

## The Problem

I inherited a unwanted Blue Snowball from [an old employer](https://37signals.com/) several years ago, and it's been a really fantastic addition to my day to day kit, especially as the number of video calls has increased in recent years. The only problem I had with the microphone started when I upgraded my monitors to some portrait orientation screens. These come almost all the way down to the desk, and as a result the (in my opinion rather ugly) original Blue Snowball microphone stand rather got in the way, even at it's shortest setting.

I was able to "fix" the problem of the microphone being in the way by laying the microphone flat. This wasn't ideal, it took up a lot more room, looked bad, and made it sound like I was lying down. Still, it worked for long enough.

## The Solution

I'm always looking for a problem where the solution is "3D print something", and this seemed like a perfect fit. An hour with Fusion 360 later and I had a stand I liked.

I'm really happy with it, it fulfils all the criteria I had when I started designing it, and I'm particularly happy with the way it looks:

- Is as minimalistic as possible. I don't want clutter.
- It's also fairly elegant in terms of looks (in my opinion of course), I have to look at this thing every day.
- Fits the screw threads on the Blue Snowball mic. I want to position it myself and don't want it swivelling around if a cable gets nudged.
- Rises as low as possible above the desk. I don't want it blocking the view of my monitors.
- Allows room for the microphone to be tilted without the cable fouling on the desk.

## Print one yourself

I've uploaded the STL files for you to print yourself. There's the [v3 design](<files/blue_snowball_desk_stand/Blue snowball desk stand v3.stl>) which is the one I use, and the [v5 design](<files/blue_snowball_desk_stand/Blue snowball desk stand v5.stl>). The two versions are very similar, the difference is only that the v3 version has a curved underside, and the v5 version has been designed to not require a support structure while printing. V3 is my preferred version and is probably less prone to wobble.

If you are printing these yourself due to the fine thread you will likely want to use a fairly high quality print setting.
